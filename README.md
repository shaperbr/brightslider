# Bright Slider Zenbook Duo
Slider for second display to run on Asus Zenbook Duo

This should be run with https://github.com/Plippo/screenpad-tools 

# Installation
For the installation you will need to install PyQt5

pip install PyQt5

To run, just use python3 slider.py and it will open on your second screen at the top left.
Should be on gnome system tray to show, hide and close.
I suggest to put it into gnome initialize.
